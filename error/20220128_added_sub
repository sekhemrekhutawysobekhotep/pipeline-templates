so I added my sub as per

              - task: AzureCLI@2
                displayName: Some Shell Goes Here
                inputs:
                  scriptType: bash
                  azureSubscription: 'eb51b472-472e-428b-9b8e-fb8c326e375a'
                  scriptLocation: inlineScript
                  inlineScript: |
                    set -e
                    echo
                    echo "hello middle ground"
